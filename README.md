# Payment Service

## Doc

```bash
$ docker-compose exec service_doc /bin/sh
```

```bash
sphinx-quickstart
```

After answering some questions about my project, the command generates some files. Iâ€™ve moved the autogenerated conf.py and index.rst in the /etc/Sphinx/source folder in the container:

```bash
$ mv conf.py /etc/Sphinx/source
$ mv index.rst /etc/Sphinx/source
```
